## Annual objectives
1. **No administrative access without MFA** (target 100%).
2. **Restore test completed and recorded** for at least one sample instance per year.
3. **Patch & vulnerability management**: all critical vulnerabilities handled within internal SLA.
4. **Incident response**: event triage within 24h, containment per runbook.
5. **Auditability**: 100% of production changes via PR/Change record.

## Suggested KPIs
- % MFA enforcement (GitHub/Hetzner/overlay)
- Mean restore time (restore test)
- MTTR for critical incidents
- Mean patch time for High/Critical CVEs
- # privileged access exceptions approved
