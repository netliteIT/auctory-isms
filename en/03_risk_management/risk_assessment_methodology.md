## Purpose
Assess and treat information security risks within the ISMS scope.

## Method
1–3 scale for Likelihood (L) and Impact (I). Risk Score = L × I.

### Likelihood (L)
1. Unlikely
2. Possible
3. Likely

### Impact (I)
1. Low (limited impact, quick recovery)
2. Medium (meaningful service disruption/breach)
3. High (enterprise customer impact, data loss, significant downtime, legal impact)

### Thresholds
- 1–2: low (monitor)
- 3–4: medium (treat where cost-effective)
- 6–9: high (treatment required)

## Frequency
- Risk review at least annually and after significant changes or major incidents.

## Mandatory outputs
- Risk Register
- Risk Treatment Plan
- SoA aligned to risk treatment
